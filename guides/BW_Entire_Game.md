# Getting through Pokemon black and white

As usual, there's a long scene at the start of the game. Pick your name, then save after by pressing select, going down to the bottom, then hitting A twice.
Press Select again, go down to save again, then press Right. Hit A to open the options menu, then go right to set the speed to fast. Go down 5 to save and hit A to save your options. Save your game again if you want.

## Select your starter.

Go to the bottom left corner of the room. Move all the way right until you hit something, then go up until you can go right.
Push down to be up against something and press A. If nothing happens, move right one step and press A again until you talk to someone. Keep pressing A until you hear a little jingle sound that goes on for a little while.
You now have your three starter options presented to you.
If you want Snivy (grass type), just press A.
If you want Tepig (fire type), hit right once then hit A.
Lastly, if you'd prefer Aushawott (water type), press right Twice and hit A.
This decision cannot be changed later unless you start all over.
Press A a few times and you'll hear a little jingle to tell you you've picked it.

## Two rival battles

Keep pressing A or B until the fight starts. The first is Bianca, so keep using your first attack (probably Tackle) until you win.
Next you fight Cheren so do the same thing.
Okay, so you won both fights, which means your starter is now at level 6 (it started at 5)

## A few little scenes

Go all the way: Left, up, right, up, right. You'll find some steps to go down which is represented by a little bouncing sound.
This throws you into a scene with your mom.
After this, go down all the way, then tap right and down until you leave the house (same sound as going down stairs). This is usually how you find exits of buildings.
Leaving will throw you into another quick scene.
To reach the southwest corner of town, keep going left, then down, until you cannot move in either direction anymore. Then take 3 or 4 steps right and go up to hit either the door of Bianca's house, or the side of the building. Search around for the door if you have to, but don't let yourself run north or you won't be near the house anymore.
Yet another little scene is in this house.
There's just one more little scene in the lab, which is a bit tricky to get into because Cheren blocks the entrance until you talk with him. We're stuck, right? Well not if you:
Go to the northwest corner,
Go right so you hit the side of the building, then go south and try to move right until you've gone around to the front of it. The person directly right is not Cheren, so go right to go around them and then talk to the next one you come to while moving right (keep clicking A).
You'll go through a scene; answer No (B) to the professor's first question (you don't likely want to nickname your pokemon), then Yes (A) to her second question (you want to help her).
Leave afterwards (south as usual).
Another scene runs as you leave and you'll receive a map, but more importantly the way out of town, which is the northeast exit, is no longer obstructed. Go there now.
A scene occurs as you leave, and afterwards sit back and listen to the how to catch a pokemon tutorial movie.
Basically, attack the pokemon so it's health is lowered to make it easier to catch. Then on the battle screen go left to items and press A, then right to pokeballs and press A several times until you throw one (if you have them). Hopefully you catch it and hear the jingle you heard in this scene, if not press A a few times on the next turn to try again.

Now just press A or B a few times to get through the rest of the scene; you'll receive some pokeballs from the professor.
Now would be an excelent time to save your game as we're now about to go through a route where there are pokemon to fight.
There are Patrit and lillipup on this path; catch them if you want, but I'm just going to snag a lillipup along the way so later I can evolve it into a low level Watchog and teach it strength to move big rocks out of the way.

## Route 1

To cross Route 1 and reach Acumula town, just go north. You'll hear when you are walking in grass, which is important because this is when wild pokemon attacks happen. Fight your way north until you reach the end of the first patch, then:
Go up 8 or so steps or until you can go right several steps. Now Go one step left, then up until you go through grass and hit someone. Talk to them to get a potion which heals pokemon when they are hurt.
After this, just take a step left to go around this person, then run north for a while and you'll reach your next scene and the entrance to your next town. Press A instead of B at the start of the scene or you'll cancel it and have to press up to enter again. After the scene continue north until the new music starts.

## Acumula town

Save. Pokemon centers are where you heal your pokemon, and in this town it's about 4 steps to the right of the entrance, and then up. Now search along this building for the door, but in this case you'll run into the professer so talk to her for a scene.
Note: sometimes when searching for doors, you'll hit an object and have to tap down a time or two in order to continue right or left to go around it, then you can push up to hit it and continue your search. This will probably happen in this case too.
After the scene, the pokemon center music starts so run forward to the nurse and press A several times. You will hear your pokemon being healed. Make sure you do this as you cannot continue otherwise.
Go south and search left for the exit. After a bit of diologue go up to enter again.
Go right all the way, then 3 steps up and right all the way to reach the mart's top counter. The lower counter, which you could have reached by only doing one step up instead of 3, sells useless things like mail which you don't need. Press A.
After a few presses you'll hear the unusual beep that means you selected something, in this case it's buy. You start on poke balls, and pushing down will take you to potions. These are the only items available. Pressing A on one of them will ask you how many you want and you start on 1. Going up adds one each time, so go up 4 times if you want 5 pokeballs, for example.
After the ching sound which tells you that you bought something, pressing A until 2 more beeps brings you back to the item select screen and you'll start on whatever you just bought.
Go down to the next item if you want to buy something else, otherwise just keep hitting B until you are out.
Personally, I won't be buying anything at this time as I feel I can get through the next couple of areas on just the free items found on the map.
Go south and search left for the exit.
Right after leaving, just run streight left for your first scene with Ghetsis and a battle against N. This is like a little mini boss, but use your starter's 3rd move (one down), as long as you fought a couple of pokemon on route 1 you'll have this, and with the potions you just bought he'll be easy. If the music changes to beeping, instead of attacking hit left to go to items, then A a bunch of times to drink a potion and heal. You'll have to manually navigate back to items on the next turn though.
Save after the fight. You can save any time as when you start again you'll be in exactly the same spot.
Move about 7 steps left then go up. You'll hit a house so search for the door. Inside, find a staircase in the top right.
After the stairs, go 2 steps down, 1 step left and down until you hit someone who gives you a free pokeball.
Find the stairs again in the top left (all the way up, right, up then left should work) then find the exit of the house.
Now just go far left to enter a little gatehouse and then further left to enter a new route. This is the far west point of the town if you need to find it again. The entrance of Acumula where you came in is the south of town in case you want to come back and heal or something.
Anyway, time to explore route 2 and go to Striaton city.
This route has the same pokemon as last time as well as Purrloin.
Just go left and you will find a scene with your mom almost right away.
Now go Left, up, right 2 grass steps and then down to hit a potion on the ground. A to pick it up. If you didn't hear 2 grass steps and a pokemon appeared, then the step didn't count so after the fight continue right until you do reach the 2 steps.
After picking it up, go up all the way and then right until you start a trainer fight. Your first trainer only has Patrit and is an easy win.
Now go right, up, a step down, and right. This is the next trainer. This one just has a purrloin but is still easy enough.
If you need to heal at this point (I did), hit select, then go down 2 to bag and press A. You start on the Items pocket or whichever pocket you last accessed. Move right to reach Medicin then hit A a few times and you'll hear a sound who's pitch quickly goes up to tell you your health has been restored. You probably don't have enough HP to require 2 at this point, but later in the game you might have to keep pressing A until it happens again. Now hit B until you are out of it.
Keep track of how many of each item you have, in the order you received them. Right now you should only have poke balls in the items pocket and potions in the medicin pocket.
Each time you use one, you should document this; when you have zero of an item, remove it from the list entirely, or just don't let it reach 0 by going to buy more before this happens. This prevents you from looking for an item later and saying: "Hmm, I wonder which spot it's in?"
This is more important in the items pocket. If you forget which pocket you accessed last, save your game, then turn it off and back on. This resets your position in your bag entirely.

Continuing, go up, then right until your 3rd grass step, then up until your next trainer fight, acknowledging that wild battles may happen along the way.
Before your next fight, there are 2 free items to get: a pokeball and a potion. To get them,
Take a step down and then go right, down, left, press A to get one.
Take 3 steps left, go up, and press A for the other.
Go right, then up, then left.
Go down until you can go left and then go north. Keep tapping left and up until you move north and encounter Bianca who will battle you.
She starts with a lilipup and then uses her starter (she chose the one that is week to your own, so use your elemental move to knock it out quickly.
Head streight north to enter Striaton city. This is the first gym city, but we cannot go to the gym just yet. Even if we could, we couldn't win at this point, because the gym leader always has the elemental type that is week to your own; grass if you have water, water if you have fire and fire if you have grass. Not only that, but there are events which must be completed all over town before we'll even be allowed passage into the gym.

First thing's first: head 4 steps up from the very beginning, right, then up until you hit a building. You have to enter this one through the left hand side, so tap left and then up until up doesn't result in you bumping into it, then hold right to enter (staircase sound). If you don't enter, tap up again and then try right. There are lots of these kind of buildings throughout this game.

Once inside, just go east, then north, then east 2 steps, then south. You'll hit someone. Talk to get a free great ball, a pokeball with a better catch rate.
Search south and west for the exit, which you press down to go through instead of left, in spite of you having to press right to enter. Odd, I know.
Back outside, take 4 steps south, then go west until you crash, then south and press A to pick up an X speed, a one time use item which you can use during a battle to increase a pokemon's speed. It expires either when the fight ends, when the pokemon is knocked out, or when you switch to a different pokemon. If you're a real strategist, you might be able to use this during a tough trainer battle before the trainer sends out their toughist pokemon just to give you that extra advantage to pull off the win.
Head north, east, and north again. You are now hitting a building which you need to go around. You are facing it, and you want to put it behind you, so head left until you can move north, hit right to bump into it, north until you can go right (if you enter the building doing this, hit down to exit, take a step left and then continue this paturn). If you hit something to the north, take a step left to go around it. Once you don't hit something going right, push down to hit the back of it. Now move right until you can move down, past the building. You'll hit something. If it's a person and you can talk to them, that's good; you'll receive a dusk ball, which is another type of pokeball which has a better catch rate at night or in dark places. Use this if you are playing at night or if you want to catch something while inside a cave.
If you just hit a wall, tap right and you'll hit this person right away. Talk to them to receive the item.
From here, go left to hit something, then tap up until you can move left and don't hit it (it's more than 8 steps so you can safely tap up this many times, then start doing this paturn). After this, take 2 more steps up, 12 steps left, then head up to enter the pokemon center. Otherwise search for the door.
Run up and heal, then run down to exit.
If you need to buy more items (there are still only the pokeballs and potions available), use the same steps as last time.; up to re-enter, right, up 3, right, press A.
I suggest that you buy only what you really need, as you'll want your cash available to spend on better items later. After you win a gym badge, the mart's invintory will be upgraded so you'll be able to buy new items, in this case super potions, which heal your pokemon more than regular potions do.
Either way, leave afterwards.
Head to the east tip of the city; you'll have to tap up a couple of times on the way.
The music will change; this is the entrance to the dreamyard.

## Dreamyard

Head streight east to encounter
2 trainers. The first has 2 purrloin, the second has 2 patrit and a lilipup; more easy battles to get your pokemon up a few levels.
After the fights, go east and try to talk to someone. If she's not there go west a few steps, then go east again. Do this until you talk with this person. She's moving around so you might have to take some time to try and catch her. A step up might help as well.
Keep pressing A so you say yes when she asks a question, and you'll receive a pokemon which has an advantage against the gym leader.
If you chose Snivy as your starter, the gym leader will have the fire type monkey Pansear, so you will receive the water type monkey Panpour to counter this.
If you chose Oshawott as your starter, the gym leader will have the grass type monkey Pansage, so you will receive the fire type monkey Pansear to counter this.
If you chose Tepig as your starter, the gym leader will have the water type monkey Panpour, so you will receive the grass type monkey Pansage to counter this.

Go around this person and get to the far east. Now go north as far as you can and move left until you can move north further. Go north all the way, then east, then 3 steps back to the west, then south until you hit an item; an X defend. Pick this item up; it works the same as the X speed item, except it razes a pokemon's defence stat.
It's now time to leave the dreamyard for now, but there's a quest coming up here soon.
Go west, south, east until you can go further south, south all the way, west, a step north, west to exit.

Now we need to collect a couple of random items placed around the city before moving on.
Go west,
south,
take a step east to avoid a person,
south,
go west, you'll run into another NPC.
go north one step,
go west,
one step east,
go south,
go 2 steps east,
south,
West,
2 steps north,
west,
south,
east to pick up another great ball; we now have two of these.
We now need to get out of this area.
Go north,
east until you can go north,
North,
East and you'll hit something right away,
South until you can go east,
East (if you hit someone, take a step north and continue east),
south,
west and you'll hit right away,
north until you can move west,
west until you can move south to find the exit of the city.
When you re-enter, moving up will actually cause you to run into the gym, but it's obstructed for now because the event at the school isn't done.
From here, just tap north and west until you can't go either way.
Go around the building to your left and enter it, this is how you can reach the pokemon center if you need to.
Later the gym will be opened so you will enter that, but just leave and push left to hit the side of the pokemon center again.

From the center, take a step west and go south,
west,
north until you can go west,
north.
Search to the left for the door to the school.
Inside, go right, up until you can go right, right, up, left until you can go up, up until you hit. This is a kid who asks you three questions, and if you answer correctly you'll receive a full heal from him, an item which can be used only once and heals any status condition. There's a moving NPC in the way who will block your way to this guy. Wait for them to get away or you won't get through.

For the first question select the first answer (out of 2), the first answer for the second question, and the 3rd answer for the 3rd question.
Head south and search left for the door just to give yourself a reference. Head back in, go north all the way then east to hit your rival Cheren. Talk, answer yes (so don't press B) to his questions to start a fight.
He'll open with his starter and then send out a Purrloin after you knock his starter out. If you've trained your own starter well up until now it could actually outlast his, especially since you have some potions at your disposal.
Win, and you'll receive 3 Oran berries, which just restore a bit of HP. More importantly,you'll earn access to the gym!
Leave the school. Go right until you hit something, go around to face it. Take 6 steps right and head up into the pokemon center, otherwise search for the door. Heal your pokemon, because it's time to enter the gym!
The gym is 7 steps to the right of the pokemon center. After taking 7 steps right, push up and talk to the person blocking the way (or search for him on this building's outside if you didn't reach him). He'll allow you passage after the conversation, so just walk in!

## Striaton gym

This is an easy gym. Just run forward until you hit a switch. If you hear a buzzer sound to tell you that you selected the wrong one, move right or left to try one of the other 2 (they're all in a row, and you are in the middle of the 3). Once you hit the correct one, the path will be opened so you can run forward and fight a trainer who has pokemon you've seen many times.
After the fight, do this all again; switches, run forward, fight the trainer.
Do this once more, except running forward this time will throw you into a short scene and then further running forward will take you to the gym leader. Heal up with potions if you want and prepare for the fight!

My status at this point:
Playtime: 34 min 11 sec.
Money: 7616
Items pocket: X defend (1), Dusk Ball (1), X speed (1), Great Ball (2) and Pokeball (6).
Medicin pocket: Fresh water (1), Full Heal (1) and Potion (2).
Berries pocket: Oran Berry (3)
The key items pocket just contains the map and the phone. Your invintory may deviate somewhat depending on what you've used so far and what you bought at the mart.

Pokemon: Oshawott (Level 14), Pansear (Level 10), Lilipup (untrained).
Pansear is not a pokemon that I will be using later in the game. It's just fine early on, but it lacks strong moves later in the game so I'm not going to bother training it. The only reason I have it is so I can beat this gym leader, as your starter is weak against his monkey.
His Purrloin should be easy to take down with your starter. His monkey however, will use Work Up a couple of times and then use his elemental move, which would knock your starter out just like that. Switch to your monkey and use it's elemental move until you knock his monkey out; heal if your health gets low.
If you win you'll receive the badge and the TM for work up; leave the gym through the south exit to enter another scene.
Fennyl will take you to her house and give you the Cut HM, which lets you cut down trees.

Go up and then left to go down the steps and then south to leave her house.
Outside, take a step up and you're actually in front of the gym. The exit back to route 2 is directly behind you. Take 7 steps left and go up to enter the pokemon center.
Heal your pokemon. The PC is just to the left of the nurse if you ever need to put some pokemon away or take some out, but don't put your monkey away just yet as you'll want to teach it cut. The mart now has new items available, so you should buy some stuff that you couldn't get before. Personally, I'm only going to get the super potions (3 down from the top, stronger potions), and repels (1 up from the bottom, they prevent wild pokemon from attacking you).
The rest of the items at the mart are the old stuff from before, as well as items that heal status conditions; something you don't have to worry about for a little while anyway. With my current amount of money, I could potentially buy 5 repels and 5 super potions. You might want these repels for times when you are trying to grab an item and the wild pokemon are just really throwing you off.
Leave and head back into the dreamyard.
At this point, a pokemon on your team needs to learn cut to remove a bush that blocks your path forward. Cut is not a particularely useful move in battle, so teach it to a pokemon that you are not using (Patrit is good, so is your monkey if you aren't going to use it in battle, but sadly Lilipup cannot learn it).
The TM pocket is to the right of the medicin pocket. Place your slave pokemon at the front of your team, then go to the TM pocket and go down one. When you select a TM or HM you hear 2 beeps. Keep pressing A until you hear the little jingle that tells you that you've acquired something. Now place your slave pokemon at the bottom of the list again.

## Dreamyard

Go up, then right to hit the tree. Press A and confirm that you want to cut it down. Your pokemon will make it's cry and then cut the tree, giving you access to the next area.
Go right for a scene with Bianca.
Go up and then right for a short little scene with Munna.
Go right until you can go up and you'll start another scene and 2 team Plasma grunt battles.
The first grunt just has a Patrit and the second just has a purrloin.

After this, there are a few items to get before leaving. Go up, then left, then down until you can go left, then left all the way, tap down and left (pressing A after each tap) until you grab another pokeball.
Go up, right, up, right, down, then tap down and left, pressing A after each tap, until you grab a Parallize heal; removes the parallized status condition, usually caused from attacks by electric type pokemon.
From here, go up, left, down, right until you can move down a ways, down all the way and press A to pick up an item, a potion.
After getting this one, go up, right, down until you can move right, up to hit the wall, right until you hit the last item, a repel.

To exit, go left, up, left,
take 6 steps right to avoid a passageway which you don't need, go down, tap down and right until you can't go right any further,
go up until you can go right, right until you can go down, down all the way,
up until you can go just a tad right, then up to get out of the area where the items were.
Continuing on exiting the dreamyard, head left through the grass, then down, right,
5 steps up, 4 steps right,
down, right until you can go down, down,
left until you can go down, down, left, up until you can go left, left to finally be out of here!

Now, go west, take a step back to the east, go south,
west until you can go south,
south, west until you can go south again, then south again to reach the entrance of Striaton city so you can either go to the pokemon center, or to your next destination.
Your next objective is to go back to Fennyl's house and talk to her now that you've saved Munna in the dreamyard. To do this, head up and enter the gym so you can use it as a point of reference. Leave, and then take 7 steps south, then go east to enter the house through the side.
Up, then right to go up the stairs.
Head directly south to bump into her, then talk. After receiving the first item she gives you, make sure you are pressing A instead of B so you answer Yes to her first 2 questions. You will receive a second item as well. These are the items that allow you to access the wi-fi system and store friend codes so you can battle against and trade pokemon with other live players over the internet.
Go back downstairs and leave the house. You are now directly south of the gym and directly north of the city's entrance, so head back to the pokemon center and heal before moving on.

If you want to get some items, head back down to route 2 instead.
Head all the way left, go down until you can go left, then just tap down, then left, then press A. Keep doing this until you reach a cut tree and remove it. If you instead hit something going down, go right until you can go down and around it, then down until you can go left, then continue searching for the tree.
There are 2 items here; a great ball and a super potion. Go left until you can go down twice (the first down will be very short but the second will be a good distance), then go left all the way, then up, press A to grab the first item.
Getting the second one is a simple matter of: Up, left, up, left, take it.
Now go right, down, right, up,
right, up, left until you can go up, and up to enter Striaton city again.
At last, we're done with Striaton city, so our next goal is to leave town through the northwest exit.
From the pokemon center, go left, down until you can go left,
left, down until you can go left, left,
up until you can go left, left,
up, right until you can go up,
up until the music changes. This is a totally new area, route 3- the path to Wellspring Cave and to Nacrene city! Note: the directions to leave Striaton city work from the gym as well, but if you start from the gym you'll have to "go down until you can go left" 3 times instead of twice, so just add one more in there and you're golden.

## Route 3

The pokemon here are the same, just with the addition of Pidove (flying type ) and Blitzel (electric type). I'll be catching a blitzel and training it up as it'll be useful for me later on.

Now, you need to go up, left, up, and left again to fight a trainer with Lilipup and Munna.
From here, go 3 steps left, then down, press A to battle a trainer with a Panpour.
Now take just 1 step left, go down and press A to fight a trainer with Pansear.
From here, go 4 steps left, then up to fight a trainer with Pansage.
Go all the way down, then left until you hear your 3rd sand step. Now tap up very gently (don't take a step, just face north), and press A. You should pick up an ultra ball, which is even better than a great ball. If you did take a step, just push down and then try facing up again. If you can't find it, search around in this sandbox. As long as you stay in the sand you can't get lost.

After this, go up, right, down until you can go right,
right until you can go up, up, right,
down, then go around to the front of what you just hit and find the door to enter the school.
From here, go left, down, right,
up until you can go right, right until you can go down a short distance (less than a second),
right until you can go down for a bit longer, then left to another trainer fight. Both of these trainers have Purrloin, and if you have at least 2 pokemon you'll fight both of them at once. If in a normal battle you have to press A twice to select an attack, you must do it 3 times in double battles, because after picking your move you must choose your target. Just press A here in you want to attack the first trainer's pokemon, push right and press A if you want to attack the second trainer's pokemon. Before anything will happen, you must go through the same process for your own second pokemon.
Continue going left. You'll start a fight against your rival Cheren.
As usual, Cheren opens the fight with his starter, then brings out a weak Purrloin.
He's still no threat as long as your pokemon isn't weakened already, and if it is you can go back to the school to heal.
After the match, you will see a little scene where Team Plasma steals a little girl's pokemon. After the scene go 3 steps left, then go up and grab a super potion in the grass.
Stick around here and move up and down if you want the chance to catch a pidove or a blitzel. Otherwise, go down until you are out of the grass, then go left, then go 6 steps up (press B until the scene is over if you enter it, but you probably won't), then go right, up one step, then right until you run into a trainer with Patrit, Lilipup and Pidove.
You will also win another oran berry.
From here, take 3 steps down (or until your first non grass step), then face left and press A to pick up a repel. Do this with care though, as there is a risk of falling off a ledge.
From here, just go up, then left. You'll enter a scene where Cheren asks if you want to enter the Wellspring Cave. Say yes, then push left to enter.

## Wellspring Cave

Continue left and you will fight a Team Plasma grunt with a Patrit. After this, 2 more grunts each with a patrit; Cheren also helps you in this fight.
Now that this is done there are a couple of quick items to grab before we leave. Feel free to catch a Wubat (flying type) or a Roggenrola (Rock type) if you want.
Go up, left, down, left,
down, right, up until you can go right,
right, up until you can go right,
right, up until you can go right once more,
go down to hit something, go right just until you can go down and then tap A, down, A, down etc until you pick up a hidden full heal.
From here, take exactly 4 steps right and move up. Grab this item, it's the TM for the move Thief. Be careful while grabbing this, it's also right on an edge which you'll fall off if you aren't positioned correctly.
		After getting it, you want to jump off the aforementioned ledge, so just run forward until you hear yourself fall. This ledge is just a one-way shortcut back to the entrance of the cave, so head right, then a step up and right to exit.

## To Nacrene city

Back on Route 3, go right, then down. You'll jump off a ledge. Take one more step down and then go right until you get into a scene with Bianca and the girl you just helped. You will receive 3 heal balls, which are pokeballs which restore a pokemon's health when captured.
From here, go streight south and you'll fight a trainer with a Blitzel.

After the fight, take a step up so that you can go right around the trainer. Move right until you here 4 grass steps, then move south and pick up an item, an antidote (cures poisoned status).
After this, go left until you've taken 2 non-grass steps, then go down, and right. You'll run into Cheren who tells you that the grass he's standing in contains wild double battles, where 2 pokemon come out to attack you at the same time. These work just like the double battle you fought before entering Wellspring Cave.
After this scene, it's a step right and then down until you get into a fight. This is a trainer with a Wubat.
After the battle, go down, then go left until you can go down and through some grass. After going all the way down through the grass, just go left all the way, then up and grab a great ball.
Now, go right, then up, then left to encounter a trainer with Patrit (This one tried to use Bide on me! Watch out!) and a Purrloin with the annoying Sand Attack.
After the fight, take 11 steps to the left, then go down, through a little bit of grass to reach an awakening on the ground, an item which removes sleeping status.
After getting this, go up until your first non grass step, then head left to encounter the final trainer. This one has Pidove and Roggenrola.
After this it's: Left, down until you can go left, left, down until you can go left to enter the gatehouse. Keep going left until you enter Nacrene city!

## Nacrene City

Head left. You'll enter a scene with Cheren, who will give you 3 chesto berries (same as awakening, except your pokemon holds one and will use it as soon as it is put to sleep).
After this scene, take 8 steps left and then push up to enter the pokemon center. If you were to exit this pokemon center and go streight right, you would head right out of the city the same way you came in. The pokemon center is exactly 34 steps to the left of the entrance, so if you take 34 steps left from this eastern entrance and then push up you'll be right at the door of the pokemon center.

From the center, take 16 steps left and then go up all the way. You've actually entered a house here, but you don't hear any door opening. If you can't go up, try a step right or left to get in the doorway. Once you reach the top, go 6 steps down, then go left. Try to talk to this person; if you can't, take one step up, then face left and talk to this person.
This girl asks which starter you selected. You can tell her anything you want, and you'll receive an item which boosts the power of attacks of the given type. The first option is Snivy, and so you'd receive a miracle seed which boosts grass type attacks.
The second option is Oshawott, so you'd receive a mystic water which boosts water type attacks. Lastly, the 3rd option is Tepig, so you'd receive a Charcoal which boosts fire attacks.
Whichever you choose, you should attach it to the appropriate pokemon (doesn't have to be your starter, it can be attached to your monkey or any other pokemon with appropriate attacks) right away so you don't lose track of it in your bag.
Press down to leave the house.
From here, go left, right one step, down 2 steps and press A to pick up a hidden revive, an item that brings a pokemon back when it has been knocked out. If you don't pick it up, then try moving up and down in this area while pressing A after every up or down step.
Now, take one step down, then 24 steps right. Now go up, left,
down until you can go left, left until you can go up,
up, then right. Now tap down and press A, tap down and press A, repeat until you pick up a hidden ultra ball. If you don't, then begin tapping up and pressing A until you do get it. You're actually just off to the write of the entrance to the cafe which is north of the pokemon center.
We should now explore the outer section of Pinwheel forest as there are many more trainers to fight there. Though that is supposed to be done after the Nacrene gym, we're able to explore a portion of it before just in case our pokemon are not strong enough to take on the gym, which is actually quite tough.
Go left, down, right until you can go down, down and left. You're now out of the city.

You can catch Timburr, Throh and Sawk here (all fighting types), as well as Tympole (Water type).

Now, go left, up and left. Talk to this person to receive the TM for Rock Smash. If you don't have a better fighting type move by the time you reach the gym leader, this weak fighting type move might prove useful against her.

From here, go down, left until you can go down, left, down, tap A, then tap right, down and A, keep doing this until you get into a battle with a trainer who hasMunna. She will heal your pokemon when you win.
Go right, down until you can go right a very small distance, then up, then right. Pick this item up; it's an Ether; an item which restores PP to an attack. Don't use this unless you are in a long series of fights, can't get out to heal and can't survive without a sertain attack; these items are very uncommon and cannot be bought at any location. There are a few others scattered around throughout the game, but I'd save them for the elite four or something else that's long and hard.

Go down, left until you can go down, down, left until you can go down, down until you can go right. You'll encounter a trainer streight away with Petilil and Cottonee.
After this, take 2 steps right, then move up and down until the next trainer sees you. This one is moving so you need to move up a few steps, then down a few steps (but not too far down unless you want wild grass battles).
This one has a Roggenrola.
After this fight, take one step down, 11 steps right, then go up and pick up a great ball.
Take 11 steps back to the left, go down, go right until you can go down, then go down to your next trainer fight. This one has Tympole (not one, not two, but three! Ridiculous!).
After the battle, go down, right five steps, and up. Pick up an antidote.
For another antidote (hidden), go 2 steps left from here, 5 steps down, and press A. If you don't get it, as usual tap up and down here while pressing A.
Now go down, left, right one step, then up. This is a super potion.
Now go right, up until you can go right, right, up until you can go right, and right to face your next trainer (Venepede and Lilipup).
Go right, up a step, then right. You might encounter a trainer with Timburr, who is moving. If you don't get spotted along your way, then take a step left and move up and down until you find them.
Either way, go up (right and around the trainer if you run into them), right, up, one step left, press A for a hidden Ether. If you miss it, push right to hit the wall, tap left and try pressing A again or try another tap to the left. One way or the other will work.
Go down, left until you can go down, down, then slowly tap left until you either hit something or get into a trainer match. If you hit something, then slowly tap right until you get into a trainer match; this one as well has timburr and is moving, so just keep going left and right.
After this fight, go past the trainer and reach the left side. It's likely that a step up, and if not a step down will get you around them.
Once you are all the way left go Up, Left, Up, left 5 steps, down to reach an item: Net Ball.
It's now time to head back to the city.
Go left (keep going even after you jump off a ledge), up, left, 3 steps right,
up, right, down until you can go right,
right, down until you can go right, right to exit.

Back in Nacrene City, go down, then right until you can go down for a couple of seconds. It's a long way right; but you'll hear the guy playing music outside the cafe just before you'll reach it. Now take 6 steps right, then go up to enter the pokemon center.
After leaving the center, go 5 steps left, 7 steps up, 12 steps right and then up to approach the gym and get into a battle with N.
N just has a pidove, a tympole and a timburr. The Tympole will try to confuse you.
After the battle and scenes, push up to enter some more scenes. Afterwards head up to enter your second gym!

## Nacrene Gym

Push up and you'll get into a scene and receive your fresh water for this gym. Continue up to fight a trainer with Patrit.
After the fight, go down 1 step, left 2 steps, then up to reach the first book. Read it.
For the next book, go right one step, up 5, left 3, then up to hit the book.
Next, go down, left, up, right until you can go up, up (it's a very short distance), right, fight this trainer. This one has Herdier.
For the next book, go up, right, down 1 step, right one step, up.
The directions to the next one are: Down, right, down, left 3, up.
To reach the last trainer, go right until you can go up, up until you can go left, one more step left, then up.
To reach the final book, go up, right, down one step, right one step, then up. Reading this book will open the path to the gym leader for you.

To reach the leader, go down a step, then left, then up. Now continue tapping right until you can go up, and going up all the way. Do this until you cannot go either up or right, then go down until you can go right, then continue going right and up. Keep doing this until you cannot go down or right, then go left until you can go down, then down until you can go right and reach a staircase.
Move up to reach the gym leader.

My status at this point:
Playtime: 1H 45 M 44S.

The key items pocket has the pal pad, the town map and the phone.
Pokemon:
Dewott (Level 20), Blitzel (level 18), Lilipup (Untrained), Pansear (Level 10, not used).

If you want, you can leave your oshawottt unevolved until it learns water pulse and revenge. It would help against Lenora, but only if you plan on doing a lot of extra training to get it up to level 25.
Lenora is quite difficult. She has Herdier which has Intimidate to lower your attack power right away. I suggest starting with an HM pokemon that you are not using. It'll be knocked out right away, but then you can switch to another pokemon to nullify Intimidate. If you have a fighting type pokemon, send that out and put on the pressure with your strongest fighting move. If you don't have a fighting pokemon, then the next best thing is probably to teach Rock Smash to anyone who can learn it. This is a weak fighting move but it may do more damage than any of your stronger but less effective moves at this point.
After you knock out Herdier she'll send out Watchog, which is really fast and has Retaliate which will do more damage if she uses it on the next turn after you knocked out her Herdier. Again, switch to a pokemon that you can afford to lose here, both to take the retaliate and to remove the affects of Lear. Just keep up using your strongest fighting move or rock smash, heal if you have to, and you should win; may take a couple of tries.

After the fight, go down, right until you can go down, down, then left to go back downstairs.
Go down, left until you can go down, then down to exit the gym section of the museum.
Go down until you see a long scene; then go down, left until you can go down, down, right until you can go down, then down to exit.
To return to the pokemon center, first take 9 steps left, then go down. Now, going left, go around the building to the front and enter. Note: there's a part sticking out as you go right around the side of it.
Market inventory after second gym badge:
Pokeball,
Great ball,
Potion,
Super potion,
Antidote,
parallize heal,
awakening,
burn heal,
ice heal,
escape rope,
repel.
The lower counter has:
Heal ball,
net ball,
the rest are just mail.

You should buy some super potions, a few antidotes, and a few parallize heals and awakenings before heading to the Pinwheel forest especially since you'll encounter bug and poison type pokemon. A few repels might also be a good idea if you can afford them; the wild pokemon can be pretty relentless. I already have some healing items, so I just bought a few supers.
Leave Nacrene City and go to the outer pinwheel forest, the place where we went out training before we took on the gym. The directions to do this are: Left 5 steps, up, down one step, left.

## Pinwheel forest

Go left, up until you can go left, then go left until you run into a scene. You will meet Burgh and he'll take you to the main part of Pinwheel Forest. Since we already explored the outer part, this is okay.
After this, go left, down until you can go left, then left to enter. We're now officially in; get ready for a long, challenging treck through the woods!

The pokemon here include Pidove, Sewaddle (bug and grass type), Venipede (bug and poison type), Cottonee (Grass type, black version only), Petilil (Grass type, White version only)

From the start, go left, then up. Burgh will talk to you here.
Take a step up from here and then go left to fight a double battle (Sewaddle)
Go down, left until you can go down, then down to fight a Plasma grunt with a Sandile.
To get an item (Big Root), go left, down,
left until you hear 5 grass steps, down 3,
left, right one, up, pick up the item; it increases the health gained from draining moves.
For the next grunt fight, take 7 steps right (or until you're standing on the first non grass square), then go up, then left. She uses the familiar Purrloin.
For your next trainer, take one step down, 2 left, then go up. This one has Herdier.
Next, go down, left, up 5, left 2, then up to reach a super potion.
From here, go down 8 steps and press A to get a tiny mushroom (hidden).
Take the 8 steps back up, then go west to encounter another trainer with Venipede and Timburr.
Next, take a step right, then go down, left, up, right 2, up 2, then left. Pick up this antidote.
Now just take 2 steps right, then go up and you'll get into a battle. This trainer has Pansage. You'll receive chesto berries for winning this battle.
From here, go up (it's a long way, if you ran into the trainer you just fought you didn't make it).
left, down until you can go left,
left, down, right 3,
up until you get into another fight. This trainer has Panpour. You'll receive Pecha berries for this.
After this, go down, right 3 and down 2. Press A for another one of those mushrooms.
From here, just go up, then right. You'll face another Grunt, this one with Patrit.
After the fight, take a step down and go right, then up. Go left until you can go up, then up until you can go right, then right, then up to receive a parallize heal.
After picking this up, take a step down and go right to fight your next trainer. This one has Pansear and will give you more Pecha berries.
From here, just go streight up. This final grunt has Patrit and Sandile. Some scenes follow and you'll receive a moon stone.
Afterwards, take a step right and then go down, right, down, right,
2 steps up, 5 steps right, then up to get an item: Miracle seed.
Continue right until you jump off a ledge. There are three more trainers to take care of before leaving. First, go down, then go right 6 steps, down, and press A to fight a trainer with Pidove and Purrloin.
Next, just take a step right and then go down to reach the next one; this one with Wubat X3.
Now, simply continue down to encounter the last one; he just has a Munna.
After this is done, just go up to leave the forest; you'll hear the familiar route music. This is the last location with this music.
Just go up 3 and then right to enter a gatehouse.
As soon as you enter take 2 steps right, then go up. Talk to a person to receive a quick claw; this item, when held, gives your pokemon the chance to attack first.
Now go down, right, up, right, up. You've now entered Skyarrow bridge. It's a long bridge, but just run streight up for nearly a minute and you'll reach another gatehouse; inside, just go up then left to enter Castelia City!

## Castelia City

There's a ton to do here. We'll be catching a Darumaka for your next gym, as well as collecting EXP share by battling a bunch of trainers, as well as the amulet coin by tracking a group of trainers down who are hiding all over this massive city.

To start, get on the pier which is south of the entrance.
On the pier, go down, right, up one step, right 2 steps, down, then right. Talk to this person. He will ask you if you have Pansage, Pansear or Panpour, and he'll give you a stone that will evolve the one you picked.
After talking to him, take a step up and then go left until you get back on the main street.
Even though this city is massive, it's not too hard to navigate and the pokemon center is pretty easy to get to. Once on Main Street, go up and then move left along the top. You will have to go around things by going down and left a couple of times. Eventually you'll reach the entrance to Mode Street; come back out and push streight left to hit the side of the pokemon center!
The mart still sports the same old invintory so don't bother with it unless you are running low on something.

At this point we'll leave town to go catch a pokemon.
Head streight west, then up to enter gym street.
Take a step left and Go north to enter the plaza.
Go up, right, up, 7 steps right, then up to enter another street.
Now just go north for a long time, through a gatehouse and then out of the city!
Route 4

We're here for Darumaka, a great fire type pokemon that'll help you to no end with the upcoming bug-type gym. The other pokemon here are Sandile and Scraggy.
To start, go left until you hear 6 steps in deep sand. This is where wild pokemon appear, so you may encounter some pokemon including Darumaka. If you encounter a Darumaka you should catch it now, as you'll want this for the rest of the game.
At this point, go 6 steps down, then go left. If you want to battle or catch pokemon here, just move left and right. Otherwise, go all the way left and then lightly tap up until you can go left. Keep doing this. When you cannot go left or up, then lightly tap right until you can go up. Keep repeating this process until your steps are silant as this means you've found a little staircase leading to 2 fishermen.
Once you reach it at last, go left all the way, one step right, then go down and press A to battle a fishermen with some basculin.
Now go right one step, down, right 2 steps and down. Press A to fight another fishermen with 4 more Basculin.

Next, go up, left until you can go up, then up.
Now go right until you hear 2 steps in packed sand. Then go up. The ground will change to deep sand, then back to packed sand. After it does this you need to walk for 3 steps in packed sand.
Then go left, then up, then right to fight another trainer who owns 2 tympole.
Next, go left, then down. Pick up a great ball.
From here go right, up, right, left one, face down and pick up a hidden ultra ball.
Next, go left, down until you can go left, left until you can go up, up until you can go right, right 3 steps, then go up and pick up a hyper potion.
After this, go down 3, left 3, then up to fight a trainer with 2 Roggenrola and a tymburr.
Now, go up, then go right until you can go up, up, right until you can go up, and then up again to fight your next trainer; this one with just Timburr.
Go left, up until you can go left, then left, then up to reach the TM for Torment.
Next, go right 3 steps, then go down until the ground changes to deep sand, then back to packed sand and you hear 3 packed sand steps. Now go left, right one, down, face up and pick up a hidden Ethor.
For the final item here (for now), go right, up one, right, up 7. Press A for a hidden burn heal.
There's nothing left to do here until we get through the upcoming gym so it's time to leave.
Go down, up one step, right until you can go down a bit, down, right until you can go down further, down, left, up until you can go left, left until you can go down,
down,
up until you can go right, right, up until you can go right again, right, down until you can go right, right until you reach a short patch where there's no sand, then down to exit.

When you get back into the city, go streight down to enter the plaza again.
Now go right, down, right then down to enter the next street. Continue down to get back to main street.
Now just push left and you'll hit the side of the pokemon center.

Go right until you can go up to enter Castelia Street.
Here, go up until you can go right; keep doing this until you cannot move in either direction. Then go left until you can go up, then up until you can go right to enter a house from the side.
Go up, then left, then down. Talk to this person to add a pokemon to your dex.
Go down, take a step right, go down to exit.
To reach the next building, go 3 steps left, then 13 up, then go left to enter.
Go streight up the elevator, keep pressing A to go up.
Go down, then left. Do this three more times. Then go right, then down. Now go right 3 steps and go up. Talk to a person to receive the TM for Rest.
To get out go left, up, left, up, right, up, down 3, right 4, up. Take the elevator back down and then head streight down to exit.

Now go up, right until you can go up, and up to enter the plaza.

We're now in search of the amulet coin. The goal here is to locate a dancer and take him on in a fight; at which time he'll ask that you go find his other two pals and fight them as well.
To find the first one, from the entrance of the central plaza go up 13 steps, then go left. Talk to him and say yes. He uses Pansage, and so the other two will use the other elemental monkeys.
Go down, left, right one step, then down to enter Narrow Street.
Take 8 steps down and then go left. This is one of the dancer's pals; talk to him to fight his Panpour.
After winning, go 9 steps down, then right until you enter a cafe.
Inside go left, up until you can go left, left, right 2, up. This person will give you a lemonade.
After getting this, go down, then right until you can go down to exit.
After this go down, then go left until you can go down. Going down, a guy jumps out of a dumpster and gives you flash.
Go down until you leave the streat, continue and hit a wall. Go left until you can go down to enter unity pier, where the last of the dancer's friends are.
Go right two steps and then go down, talk to him to battle his pansear. Now just go up to leave the pier and be back on the main drag.
Now go up 5 steps and then go right to leave the city the way you first came in. Go back in and head to the pokemon center. Now return to the plaza where you battled the first person and you'll finally get the amulet coin. The new directions here are: up 14, left, down 2, left 3, up. Talk and you'll finally get the coin. It's an item that doubles the money earned by fighting trainers if a pokemon holding it took part in the battle.
Now go right and down to reenter Castelia Street, then continue down to get back on Main Street. Now you can just go left to hit the side of the pokemon center. Go in if you need.

## The battle company

Go left until you can go up. Keep doing this, going down to go around when you can't move in either direction; eventually it'll lead to the entrance to another street. Leave the new street and then go streight left to hit the side of the building. Go around and enter.

Go streight up to the elevator and pick the first option to go up.
Head streight down to battle a trainer with a Roggenrola.

To return to the elevator, go left, down 9, left, up, left until you can go up (2 small amounts and then one larger one), and this should put you at the elevator. Pick the first option, then go streight down to finally be out.
Now take a step down, then go right so you can be at the entrance and find the pokemon center again.
From the pokemon center, just go left all the way, then up to enter Gym Street.
Take 7 steps up, go right, then up, left one step, up, left one step, up three steps and then right to activate a scene.
We now have to go to prime pier for some more scenes, so head down until you exit Gym Street.
Next, go down, left one step, down three, right 53 steps and then down. You'll enter the pier and have some more scenes.
Afterwards, go up to leave the pier. Then go 4 steps up, then left all the way (there's a short piece of dialogue near the end), then up to be back on Gym Street.

Now go 2 steps right and then push down to leave the building.
Now go 2 right, 15 down, and then right should put you in the gym! If not you are really close, so search for an entrance which you have to go right to enter.

## Castelia Gym

For your fresh water, go right, up one, right one, then up and talk to him.
After getting it, take 2 steps left and then run forward. You'll run for a while, go through a wall of honey and then hit a switch. When you hear yourself going through the honey, don't stop moving or you'll just be bounced back out.
From here, take 2 steps down, go right and press A to fight a trainer with Sewaddle and Venipede.
From here, go a step down, 2 steps right, up, and right to hit another switch.
Go down, left, down, left 3 steps, then up until you cross some honey and step on a trap switch. A trainer will battle you here with Sewaddle and Dwebble.
Go up, left, up, and left again to hit a switch.
Now go right, down, right, up and right to hit a second one.
Now go down, left, right one step, and down to hit a 3rd switch.
Now go up 2, right 12, then up to go through some more honey and hit another switch.
Go down until you get back through the honey. Go left, right one step, and down until you get through some more honey.
Go down, left, one up, left, one up, left, up, then left to hit another switch trap. You'll fight another trainer with a Sewaddle.

Go back down, through the honey.
Go left one step, down, right, left one, up until you go through 2 walls of honey and end up fighting another trainer, with Venipede and Sewaddle.
After the fight just push up to hit the final switch!
Go back down through the honey; stop when you reach the end of it. Now take 6 steps right, then run forward until you cross 
the last wall of honey and bump into burgh!

My status at this point:

Burgh has three pokemon: Venipede, Dwebble and Leavanny. He's pretty easy if you have a fire type pokemon like Darumaka to take out Venipede; then he'll send out Dwebble, which you'll want a water attack to deal with quickly; then he'll send out Leavanny which a fire type move will make short work of. Burgh shouldn't be much of a threat whatsoever.

To get out, go streight down to get through a wall of honey. Go down all the way, right 7, down until you try to go through honey but can't, left one step, down through the honey, left, right one step, down, through the honey and out.

## Finishing up in Castelia

Right after you leave the gym, Bianca calls you because she wants a match.
Go down, left 2 steps, then down to get back on Main Street.

In this gatehouse go right and talk to a person. You will receive the macho brace. Though not useful right now, this will be useful later when you finish the game and decide to train a team for competitive battles online, as it doubles the speed at which your pokemon's stats grow, making it easier to train pokemon in specific stats.
Next, go down, right, up 2, then right to enter route 16.

## Route 16

This doesn't lead anywhere important right now, but there are a few trainers to fight for battle experience.
You can also catch Liepard, Trubbish, Minccino, Gothita in black and Solosis in white. Catch these if you want.
Upon entering, go right until you battle a trainer with herdier (this actually gives a lot of battle exp).
Next go down, right 3, then move up and down until you encounter a trainer with Ducklett and Liepard. This one is biking around, so you might have to be patient.

After getting out, go down, right, down, left, down, left, down, 7 steps right, then up. You'll face a trainer with Scraggy.
There is a big bolder here, with some items behind it. Currently, we cannot do this yet as strength is not enabled until after the next badge, so we'll come back for that then.
There is however, one more trainer we can fight. Go all the way right, then move up and down until you are spotted by a trainer with 2 Whirlipede.

We'll head back into town now, and check out the west exit.
Go left, down, left, up, then left to reenter the gatehouse.
Just keep going left to reach the city.
When you arive back in Nymbasa, just head left to reach bianca. She'll drag you to the musical hall where she will make you explore it just a little bit.
Say yes, otherwise you can't move on.
If you are playing on a real DS, this part is easy. Take your stylus and click on the bottom of the bottom screen right in the center. You'll hit one of the pieces of clothing and hear a beep. Then click near the bottom left corner. You'll hear a chime and will be out of this for good.
If you are playing on a computer, things might be a bit more complicated. You have to hit these two buttons with your mouse, which is difficult because it's possible to click outside the game and activate something else on your computer. An automation script might work if you can get someone to point the mouse for you and you collect it's positions, otherwise just ask someone to click on the two okay buttons on the screen.

After this, go through the text. For a TM for echoed voice, go up, right, down, left 2, up and talk to someone.
Go left, down, left 7, then hit down to leave. You'll now see the sad seen between bianca, her father, the gym leader and you.
After this, go down, left until you can go down, then down to reach the entrance. You can reach the pokemon center from here.
After leaving the center, go right, up, left one, up, left one, up 16 and left to exit the city through it's west gatehouse.

## Route 5

As soon as you fall go right. You'll bump into a trainer with Blitzel who you'll need to fight, but you might also be stopped by one with 2 darumaka on the way. If not, move left and right until you fight that one before taking on the blitzel trainer.
From here, take a step down and go right. Press A to fight, if that doesn't work move left and right pressing A.
This one has Whirlipede.
For the next one, go all the way right, around the trainer if you have to. Go down, then right 3, then up. Press A to fight this one.

Go all the way left, then up to reach the biker who will fight you in a tripple battle or rotation battle depending on version. It's possible he won't be right there, just keep moving up, perhaps up and down a bit and you'll reach him.
His team consists of Basculin, crokorok and Zebstrica.
We won't explore the market too much now, because you might not have a pokemon that is over level 30. This is a requirement for getting one of the optional items there. We'll save that for after the gym, but there is a section of it which we can take care of right away because we're so close as it is.

She started with Herdier, then her monkey, then her starter, then Musharna (Munna's evolution).
The prize for winning this fight is a great one; the ability to fly! Kinda sad that it comes so late in this game; whereas in Diamond and Pearl you get it streight away after gym number 3. This lets you return to previous locations instantly. Better yet, you never need to know where pokemon centers are because fly lands you right in front of it. Just walk into a city and then fly to the same city and you're right there!
Teach this to Cigilyph if you want.
