Press alt v, then l and check the Horizontal option.
Then go to config, frame skip, and uncheck the Auto-minimize skipping option, then go to the same menu and mark option 3. That's it, you can start playing.

## Chapter 1: Introduction:

When you load the rom and the game, a text by Professor Serbal will appear giving information about him, the pokemon world and others. Then he will ask you if you are a boy / girl (the girl option is to the right of the boy) and then you will have to type your name, here the keyboard.
In the first row are the buttons to finish, lowercase, etc.
Now the other rows are.

The other row has pure blanks.
Finally, see one above the first row (the one with the letter a) and one on the left. To delete simply press b, (z)
When you write your name it will ask you the name of your rival, here the options.

When you finish putting your name then the typical message will appear, your pokemon adventure is about to begin! And the music will change.

## Chapter 2: Hojaverde people.

The game begins with your character in his room, watching an informative about an investigation of Professor Serbal on the television. Press z to close the dialog. You will begin to hear the relaxing music of Hojaverde people.
Before doing anything I will tell you how to change the speed of the text. First press the s to go to the options menu, then go down 3 times to go to the options and press x. Now go one to the right to set the text speed to fast and finally go one up and press x 2 times. You will hear a confirmation sound that indicates that the settings have been saved. Another way to save the options is by pressing z, and then a message will appear asking if you want to save the settings, the first option is yes, below is option no.
Go one to the right and you will hear a beep indicating that a dialogue has started. It is your rival who will tell you that Professor Serval is in a sandy town and will ask you to accompany him so he can give each one a pokemon.
Leave your room by going 3 to the right, 2 up and one to the right. When you go down the stairs a dialogue will begin with your mother who will tell you that your opponent has already left.
Go all the way down, 4 to the left and another dialogue will begin with your mother, who will tell you that you cannot walk through the tall grass until you have a pokemon. Close the dialogue and leave your house by going down one. Now go to your rival's house, 12 on the left, all up and one on the right, because when you get to the door your rival will leave his house and tell you to accompany him to see the teacher, but then forget one thing in your room and you will have to follow it.
Enter the house going 2 up. To go to your room, see 4 on the left, all up and one on the right. When you go up the stairs your opponent will be keeping a bag and a diary, then seeing you will tell you that he is waiting for you on the road and leaves. Leave the room going one up and one to the left, and finally leave the house going all down, 4 to the right and one down.
Now see 6 on the right and all above. The music will change and you will hear a beep, since you will have reached Route 201 and a dialogue will begin with your rival, who will tell you that, if they pass quickly through the tall grass nothing will happen and so they can reach the laboratory. When they get ready to run, Professor Serbal arrives who stops them since neither of them has a pokemon and going through the tall grass is dangerous. On one hand, ask them if they love pokemon, to which you have to answer yes. Then, ask again, to which you have to answer again yes. After this the teacher scolds them by telling them that, if they are reckless enough to put themselves in danger going through the tall grass without having pokemon, they don't want to even think what would happen if they had pokemon. In that, your rival says that the most fair thing is that only he runs out of his pokemon, since his idea had been his. Because of his generosity, the teacher decides to entrust a pokemon to each one.
After this the music changes as Maya arrives, the teacher's assistant with his briefcase. When the music changes again it means that you can choose your first pokemon. Go one to the left and press x to open the briefcase (a blow will be heard when it happens) and then press x again to display the initial pokemon.
The first pokemon is Turtwig, On the right is Chimchar and on the right of Chimchar, Piplup. If you select a pokemon and do not want it, you just have to press z and it will return to the list. When you choose it, your opponent will choose the pokemon that has an advantage over yours. Then the teacher will say something unimportant and then leave with Maya. On the other hand, your rival will tell you the following: "We can only do one thing, you know it, right? To what you will have to say yes. When you do, your rival will say a few more things and start the battle!
Only the fight option will appear, since you don't have any pokemon to change, you don't have a backpack, and you can't run away.
Press select until you hear the sound that is heard when a dialogue opens, when you hear that it means that you have entered a menu, in this case, the fight menu. Then choose the attacks and wing.
When the battle is over both will go to their respective homes. You will tell your mother what happened, she will tell you to go to the village laboratory Arena to thank the teacher and give you the sports shoes. When the dialogue closes, leave your house by going 3 down.

## Chapter 3: towards sand town. The adventure begins!

Go to route 201. Of course, 5 on the left and all above. A beep is heard, it is your rival who will tell you to accompany him to the lake, since they say that there lives a legendary pokemon and his plan is to capture him. When the dialogue closes, see 3 above, all to the left, all above, one to the left and 2 above. A dialogue will begin with your opponent who will say that they are almost at the lake, then they will arrive at the Truthful Shore and the music will change. In that place is a strange guy who only reveals his name. Helio, from the galaxy team. Then he will leave and the cry of Mesprit will be heard, and your opponent realizes that he has no pokeballs and therefore, they will not be able to capture any pokemon. Then he will tell you to go with Professor Serbal to ask for pokeballs, and he will leave. Go 2 going down.

### Route 201

Pokemon that appear: Starly, Bidoof, Kricketot.
Then I will tell you where you can train. First go all down, all right, go back 7 steps to the left, all up, all left and talk. He is an employee of the store who will give you a potion.
If you want to train, move up and down, and when you finish, go all up, 2 down and all right. The music will change and you will reach Pueblo Arena, you will hear the beep as a dialogue begins with Maya, who will take you to the teacher's laboratory.
When they are going, your rival will appear, who is somewhat upset, will say that the teacher is crazy and will leave.
Note: for the following I recommend skipping the dialog with z, since in one part ask if you want to give your pokemon a name. When you change the music then skip the dialog with x, as it asks if you want to complete the pokédex.
Upon entering, After a little talk, the teacher will give you the pokedex for you to complete, and finally Maya tells you that it helps the teacher to complete the pokedex, and if you need help you can go to it.
When you close the dialog, leave the laboratory by going down until you hear the output sound. When you do, the teacher will give you the mt 27, backward and maya will teach you all the people. The pokemon center, the pokemon store, will tell you to let your mother know that you are going on a trip and will leave.
If you take two steps up you will enter the pokemon store, everything above is the employee. Here you can buy the following.
Pokeball, 200 Pokémon.
Potion, 300 Pokémon.
antiparaliz, 200 pokéyen.
antidote, 250 pokéyen.
When you finish leave the store going 5 down. Now go through the pokemon center, 10 to the left and one up.
Heal your pokemon and go down until you leave. Now, you have to go back home to say goodbye.
Before there are some small menu items that I will explain.

1. The battle menu is like crystal pokemon again.

    Battle, change pokemon
    
    Backpack, escape
	
    Now, when you go to the backpack (in a battle) the objects will appear by categories, medicinal objects (only those objects that give hp to your pokemon) and pokeballs to the right. Below the category of medicinal objects will be objects that cure the state such as awakening, antidote, etc. And to the right of that category will be the booster objects, such as attack X, Defense X, etc. The objects of each category appear in lists of 3, to go to the second list you just have to go to the right and there will be the other objects. Here an example.
    If you want to give your pokemon a potion then you have to go to the backpack menu, select to go to the first menu that is medicinal objects and there the potion will appear. Now if you want to capture it you will have to go backpack, pokeballs (one on the right) select and the pokeballs will appear.
    By the way, at the end of each category, in the first row (the one on the left) there will be a button to show more objects, if any. It would be something like a second screen of objects.
2. To see the info of a pokemon is the same as ruby ​​pokemon, the only difference is that you cannot select from the info menu, but you have to close it with z. Here an example
I have 3 pokemon, Chimchar, Bidoof and Starly. I want to see Starly's position to put it first, then I go to the pokemon menu, I go to some pokemon and then, to info. Chimchar's shout sounds, down arrow, Bidoof shout, down arrow, Starly. To change position I can not press x as in ruby ​​pokemon, but I have to close the info menu with z, press x again to get the info options, change, etc.
3. To change position to a pokemon this time is different, for good. I will continue with the example.
I go to the change option, the difference is that now the up arrow advances two positions, to advance only one you have to press the left or right arrow, that depends on the position of your pokemon. In this case, since Starly is in position 3, I can go 2 to the left to put it in position 1, or one up, since it will advance 2 positions up.
4. To find out what attacks your pokemon knows and change the position of the attacks, go to the pokemon info, 3 on the right and press select. You will have entered the attack menu. If you want to know the order of the attacks, the description appears at the end. The first attack that appears is the first attack your pokemon knows, that is, the one on the left in the top row. Below would be the second attack of the pokemon, that is, the attack that is on the right in the top row. Below is the third attack, in battle would be the attack on the left in the bottom row. And below, the fourth attack, is the one on the right in the bottom row. To change positions you only have to go to one of the two attacks to change, press select, go to the other attack and press select, here is an example.
My Chimchar knows the scratch attacks, malicious and embers. Scratch and malicious are in the top row (scratch on the left and malicious on the right) and embers, in the bottom row. I want you to be in the first attack of the top row, that is, to the left. So to change the position with scratch I go to the menu of the pokemon, info of Chimchar, 3 to the right, select pulse to enter the screen of the movements, and the first movement is scratch. I press select again to select that attack, under twice to get to the third attack (embers) pulse select and ready, I will already have embers in the first attack of the upper row, and scratch will have remained in the first attack of the lower row .
That's it.
Go one down and all to the left to get to Route 201. Then go 4 down, all left and 16 down and you will reach the town of Hojaverde.
To go home see 22 below, 6 on the right and one above. Your mother is going one to the right and one up. When you speak, he will heal your pokemon and, after a few words, he will give you a diary. It serves to write down what you do every day, that is, your character will write it down. After a little more talk, your rival's mother will arrive who will give you a package for him.
You can leave, one on the left and 2 below. Now return to Pueblo Arena to go to Route 202. First 5 on the left and all up to get to the route, then all on the right, 7 on the left, all above, 2 below and all on the right, You will reach the town. When you hit the wall on the right, go 12 to the left and one up, if you go up one you will enter the pokemon center, that will be the reference point (the exit of the pokemon center)

Get out of the pokemon center and go a long way down until you hear the entrance / exit sound, you will reach the mine. Now go all down until you go down some stairs. Here I recommend using the repellent.

With this object in hand, see 3 below, all on the left, one below, 2 on the left, one above and speak. He is the leader of the gym, who will say that the rock hit mo is quite useful for destroying the rocks, then one of his pokemon will use rock hit and finally he will return to the gym.

Ok, for this gym you have several options. If you chose Piplup or Turtwig you will have no problem defeating him. Now, if you chose Chimchar you can raise it to level 14 so that it evolves in monferno, since it learns Ultrapuño, movement of type fight.

When you defeat him, he will give you the Lignito medal, which will allow you to use the rock blow out of combat. In addition he will give you the mt 76, trap rocks.

* Antiquemar, 250 Pokémon.
* Frost, 250 pokeéyen.
* Rope run away, 550 Pokémon.
* Repellent, 350 pokéyen.

I recommend buying repellents, since, as you can see, wild pokemon are very, very annoying. When you are ready, go to Route 203, as you must return to Jubilee City to take the route that will lead you to Vetusta City. By the way, when you are arriving at Puerta Pirita, you will meet your rival who will say that the next city is Vetusta city and that you will not be able to go on route 207 since you need a bike, and for this reason you will have to arrive from Jubilee city. When the dialogue closes, see 4 steps to the left to reach Pirita Gate.
Note: you will need to show rock blow to one of your pokemon, if you do not want to take any movement from a pokemon that you already have, you can capture a Bidoof to teach the MO. The method is equal to ruby ​​pokemon.
Note 2: I recommend training Bidoof until it evolves into Bibarel (level 15) as it can learn more. If you are lazy to train it later you can capture them.

## Chapter 8: return to Jubilee city. The appearance of the Galaxy team!

When you get to the route go all left, 8 down (remember to wait half a second after hearing the shortcut sound) 38 on the left and you will reach Jubilee city. Then see 3 steps to the left and a dialogue will be presented with Handsome who will say unimportant things and then leave. From here go to the entrance of the pokemon center (13 on the left, 19 below and 5 on the right) and if you need it, cure your pokemon.
Your next destination is Route 204. When you do 34 steps above, a scene will be presented. First, Professor Serbal will say to put in his place some villains who are talking nonsense. then, they will tell the teacher to give them their research and in return, Maya will not be hurt. Then a double battle will begin, you and Maya against two soldiers of the galactic team. I recommend reading the dialogue, it is very fun to see how the teacher trolls the galaxy team. LOL.
The only thing that changes in double battle is order. Below your opponent's second pokemon (the one on the right) will be your second pokemon or, in this case, your partner's pokemon. When a pokemon falls, the place of the fallen pokemon will remain, although empty, unless your opponent calls another pokemon that occupies that place. Finally, the battles are no longer restarted when changing shifts, but the place of the pokemon you last selected in your previous turn with each pokemon is selected. Here an example.
If I have Chimchar and Starly, and my opponent takes out Piplup and Bidoof. I order Chimchar to use embers on Bidoof, and Starly to use wing attack on Piplup. On my next turn, when I attack with chimchar, the place of Bidoof will already be selected, and when I attack with starly, the place of Piplup will be selected.
Recruits Galaxy, pokemon they use: Glameow level 11, Stunky level 11.
When you defeat him the professor will congratulate you, he will say that when the pokemon evolve they release a mystical energy that we cannot control, but the Galaxy team seeks to control it. Then Maya will release a roll of dialogue about evolution and, finally they will leave, a man from the TV channel will approach you and will give you a heart box, it is used to dress your pokemon. Something unimportant.
If you want to return to the center pokemon see 36 below, 6 to the right and above. If not, go to route 204, 6 above.

## Chapter 9: Route 204 and desolate path.

### Route 204

It is not as difficult as it seems, but you only have to take into account one thing, the gears: As I said before, the gears are changed with the b (z) button, the first gear is the one that has the least prolonged sound, and logically, The second gear is the one with the longest sound. If you have trouble controlling the bike, you can get off and do everything walking, except when you need to use the second gear, there you will have to use the bike. There are 2 or 3 particular cases in which you have to jump a ramp with the first gear and you have no other option. In those cases I will say, go to that direction to jump a ramp.
That said, let's start!
First go one up and 3 to the left to climb some stairs. From here you see everything on the left, one above, 2 on the left and select, the object is a night stone. If you want to train, move from right to left, and when you finish stick to the wall on the left, go 2 to the right, 2 down, ride your bike, switch to the second gear and go all up. When you hit the wall it changes to the first gear, go one down, one to the left, switch to the second gear and go all right. If you have heard 4 shortcut sounds then you have done well. Those sounds are ramps that you have jumped with the bike.
Now switch to the first gear, go one to the left, one up and select, the object is a max ether. With this object in hand, you see everything above, all on the left, one below to jump a ramp, and one on the right to jump another ramp. Then change to the second gear and go all down, all right, all up, all left, change to the first gear, go one to the right, 4 up (don't worry if you hear a sound) change to the Second gear and go all right, one up and select, the object is a grapple hook.
From here, if you want change to the first gear and go one up, one on the right, change to the second gear and go all left to take a small jump. Then switch to the first gear, go one down, 4 left, all down, switch to the second gear, go all up, all right, switch to the first gear, all left, all down, one at the left, one above, one on the left and select, the object is a caramelorraro.
Now is the time to go for one of the best mt, earthquake. First go 3 to the left to jump a ramp. Then go 3 up, all to the left, one down, 3 to the left, switch to the second gear and go all right to jump two ramps.
This is the hardest part. First switch to the second gear and go all to the left, all up and all to the right. In this part there is a rock that you have to jump taking speed. To do this, what you have to do is go down and, before hitting the wall, go left to jump it. The way to do this is to save the game in a slot, go all down, calculate the time it takes to hit the wall (usually it is a second and a half) and then, when you know how long it takes, before you crash , go left until you jump. The waiting time to go to the left (after going down) is one second and a little more, but less than a second and a half. Anyway, you can always load the slot and try until you get it, it took me more than 20 attempts to master it.
When you jump the rock, change to the first gear and go 30 down and all right to climb some stairs. Then see one below, one on the right and select, the object is mt 26, earthquake. Exit the cave using the fleeing rope.

There is also a movement tutor who will teach a movement in exchange for a number of parts that you can find on the wiki. By the way, there is also a path with mud. The particular thing about mud is that there are black areas that if you step on them, you sink. For this reason I recommend saving the game when it says that you have to turn to pick up an object, since in most parts where there are objects, there is a black zone. You know, you just have to turn the character. If you take a step, you sink. But, as not everything is bad, when walking through the mud you hear the steps. That said, let's start!

When you leave you hear a sound similar to the shortcut sound.

What we are interested in this place is, first the left wing of the mansion. Here you can, apart from obtaining some objects, fight with 5 maids, which you will have to defeat in the number of turns they ask for. For example, if you are asked to defeat at 5 in 5 turns, you will have to defeat each pokemon in a single turn. Now, if they ask you to defeat them in 8 turns, you will have to use other moves so that the turn advances and thus be able to defeat them in the requested number of turns. If you do, you can fight with Miss Africa who will use a level 35 Blissey. The interesting thing about this pokemon, apart from the amount of experience they will give, is that it has a caramel machine equipped. If you use the thief movement, obtained earlier, you can get it. This is a quick way to obtain these objects, since the challenge can be done once a day.

Go to the next room, one below, 8 on the left, all up and select, the object is a luxury ball.
And now yes, the good is coming! Leave the room going down to exit, then one down, all left and talk. It is an npc that will tell you if you want to challenge the 5 maids, basically it explains what I have just said, then what is a turn ... Anyway, before fighting it will tell you the number of turns, they can be between 5 and 9 The only thing that could bother you is the stamina movement. If you have been told that defeats in 5 turns and use that move in one turn, you will no longer have a chance. But good! You can always save the game before fighting and try as many times as you want. Anyway, if you fail, you can also try the next day.
When you say yes, the battle will begin with the first maid.
Maid Melita, pokemon she uses: Clefairy level 25.
When the defeats will begin the fight with the second.

He knows that your intention is to save the 3 legendary sinno, but since he doesn't need them anymore he tells you that, if you wish, you can free them. Then he says pure nonsense about feelings, which seems odd that you want to rescue some pokemon that have nothing to do with you ... and challenges you to a battle!

When you defeat him he will say nonsense about feelings and so on, but then, for your courage and strength, he will give you a master ball. He will say that he does not need it, since he is not like the other trainers who want to become friends with the pokemon. Nor is it like those trainers who use them as tools as the galaxy team does, he just wants his energy. Finally, he will say that if you want to rescue the legendary, use the panel of the next room and go to the crown mount.

Chapter 30: Giratina and the distortion world. Defeating the galaxy team!
Note: in this world you have to take platforms that will make a volcano-like sound. I just want to clarify that, if I say everything on the right, it is on the right until the wall hits. When I have to go to some direction until I take a platform, I will say so. This is because there are more than 2 platforms and, to avoid having to say, on the right until you take a platform, continue on the right until you take another ... Before moving on, make sure that the sound you hear when you use a platform already don't ring That said, let's continue! Go to the right and speak until you hear a sound, you are entering through the portal. Then Cintia will say that you must look for Giratina so that the distortion does not reach the column or crush the same distortion world.

When defeating him, he will say that you will not be able to with Giratina since you are in his world and blah blah blah ... followed by this, Cintia will say some unimportant things and heal your pokemon. Then he will continue to say irrelevant things about Giratina, that you will have to defeat him or capture him to save the world, etc ... skip the dialogue with z and when it closes, go for Giratina. To do this, go up until you hear the cry of the pokemon, close the dialogue and continue up until you hear a kind of shriek (heard after the flight sound) and press select until the battle begins!
Giratina will be at level 47, and in its original form. In this way he has the ability Levitation. I do not recommend using the master ball to capture it. What I do recommend is using turn balls or ultra balls.
When you capture or defeat Elio will release a speech, skip the dialogue with z and when it closes, go up one and press select until you hear a sound, you will enter through a portal that has allowed you to return to the normal world. The portal has left you at the Farewell source. Upon arrival, Cintia will thank you and tell you to go see Professor Cerbal, who was worried about you.
