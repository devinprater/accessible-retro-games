# Guides Readme

This folder, “guides,” is to be used for hosting guides to playing
games which have been listed in the “games-list.md” file. Please do
not have any loose guides floating around, unless you are working on
having it listed in the main games list as well. In the Games-list.md
file, create a list item, and link to the file, or home (index, base)
file of your guide. For example, if it is split into parts, link to
the table of contents, and if it is split into main guide and menu
guide, link to the main guide, with a link to the menu guide within
the main guide.

if you create a move list, for a fighting game for example, please
create a folder with the name of the game you have the move list for,
and place your files in that, and link to and index for them from
there.
