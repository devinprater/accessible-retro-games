# accessible-retro-games
Resources for retro video games accessible to blind people, using Retroarch or other utilities to enjoy video games.

Included in this project (may be updated):

* A list of games which are accessible
* Save files, so that one can “jump” to a particular part of the game
* Guides for using Retroarch or other emulators

Find the list of games [here](games-list.md).
