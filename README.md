# accessible-retro-games

Resources for retro video games accessible to blind people, using
Retroarch, OCR, sound, or other utilities to enjoy video games. By
“retro” I mean any game that must be emulated in order to be played on
computers and modern systems, although older computer games which do
not have accessibility features are welcome as well.

I’ll work hard to give my fellow blind people as detailed
and up-to-date information as possible. But if you see something that
is wrong, outdated, or in need of correction, please help out by
making an issue or fixing it yourself. This resource won’t grow fast
without participation. 

Included in this project (may be updated):

* [A list of games which are accessible](games-list.md)
* Save files, so that one can “jump” to a particular part of the game

* [Guides for using emulators](emulation/readme.md)
