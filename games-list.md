# Games list

This is a list of retro video games which are
accessible to blind people using optical character recognition,
Retroarch’s AI service, or other means not normally used to access the
game. This list of games will not contain links to the ROM files of
the games unless the game is a Homebrew title, in the public domain,
or otherwise legally distributed. It is assumed that you also, in the
case of using a ROM, own a physical, or bought digital, copy of the
game. Hint: for PSP games, as long as it is supported, you may buy a
copy from the Playstation Network.

The structure of this file should be neat, availing itself to
navigation by a screen reader’s quick navigation keys. A heading level
two should be the game’s name. Under it, a description should be given
in a paragraph. Under any heading levels three, any notes about
playing the game, like what sounds mean what, OCR notes, guides for
levels, links to specific save files and what they do, menus, and so
on. There is a [games list template](games-list-template.md) that you can use.
