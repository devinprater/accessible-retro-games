# Games list

This is a list of retro video games which are accessible to blind
people using optical character recognition, Retroarch’s AI service, or
by sounds and menu structure if the game is simple enough, like Mortal
Kombat (before MK 9.) This list of games will not contain links to the
ROM files of the games unless the game is a Homebrew title, in the
public domain, or otherwise legally distributed. It is assumed that
you also, in the case of using a ROM, own a physical, or bought
digital, copy of the game. Hint: for PSP games, as long as it is
supported, you may buy a copy from the Playstation Network.

The structure of this file should be neat, availing itself to
navigation by a screen reader’s quick navigation keys. There is a
[games list template](games-list-template.md) that you can use. Guides not originally created for this repository don't have to follow this. When
ready to commit the template, no matter at what stage of work, simply
put the template, renamed with the name of the game, in the guides
folder. All I ask is that you maintain your information if it is not
already complete.
