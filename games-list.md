# Games list

This is a list of retro video games which are
accessible to blind people using optical character recognition,
Retroarch’s AI service, or other means not normally used to access the
game. This list of games will not contain links to the ROM files of
the games unless the game is a Homebrew title, in the public domain,
or otherwise legally distributed. It is assumed that you also, in the
case of using a ROM, own a physical, or bought digital, copy of the
game. Hint: for PSP games, as long as it is supported, you may buy a
copy from the Playstation Network.

The structure of this file should be neat, availing itself to
navigation by a screen reader’s quick navigation keys. A heading level
two should be the game’s name. Under it, a description should be given
in a paragraph. Under any heading levels three, any notes about
playing the game, like what sounds mean what, OCR notes, guides for
levels, links to specific save files and what they do, menus, and so
on. There is a [games list template](games-list-template.md) that you can use.

## Dissidia Final Fantasy

This game is a fighting game, with 3D combat in an open area for the
stages. There are traps and obstacles, which do not make a sound until
one interacts with them.

In Dissidia Final Fantasy, you play as one of a possible 22
characters, all with their own moves, customized by setting them to
different slots. A character gains new moves by leveling up, which can
be achieved by simply winning battles.

### Accessibility Notes

When you first start the game, you’ll be in the title screen. Press
Start to enter the Title Menu. There, you’ll find “new game,” “load
game,” and “install data.”

Press the A button on “new game,” and follow the onscreen prompts.
Note that, if using Retroarch, set your name in the “user” menu and
it’ll already be filled in for you, in the first screen where you give
your name. If using PPSSPP, you’ll have to configure the ppsspp.ini
file to change the name from “ppsspp”. After giving your name, extra
experience day, and gamer type (difficulty), you can continue to the
tutorial.

The tutorial will teach you how to play Dissidia, but here are the
things you must know, in case OCR, or the AI service in Retroarch,
doesn’t read the keys to press properly:

#### Keys

* To use a bravery attack (BRV), use the B button. You can use
  different BRV attacks by using B in combination with Up or Down on
  the left analog stick.
* Use A to jump.
* Use Y to interact with stage objects, like to jump down from
  a ledge, or zip across ... whatever that thing is.
* Use X to do an HP attack. Again, use Up and Down to perform
  different HP attacks.
* Use R to block an attack.
* Use L to lock onto an object, like an X-core. You are automatically
  locked onto your opponent at the beginning of a battle.
* Use R+A to dodge.
* Use R+Y to dash towards whatever you’re locked onto.
* Use R+X to enter Ex-mode, when your ex-gauge is full.

#### Music volume

The music can be turned off. To do this, when in the main menu, after
the title screen, move up one, press A, then move up seven times, and
press right, then B to exit options.

### Sounds

Many events in Dissidia  have sounds.

* When an Ex-core appears, you’ll hear a sort of magical chime.
* When you fall into a trap, you’ll here a lower sound reminiscent of
  of “stop” sound, then a higher sound when you can move again.
* When you lock onto an opponent, you’ll hear a metallic ding. When
  you lock onto an Ex-core, you’ll hear a smaller one. When you are
  not locked onto anything, you’ll hear a retracting sound.
* You will know when a summon has appeared when battle is paused, and
  unusual sounds play. One may be able to memorize these sounds and
  link them with summons to know what effect is being done.
